# Mathletics

## Origin
After finishing "Python Data Science Handbook'' by Jake VanderPlas I found myself with most of the tools to tackle data science problems but without the knowledge to really dive into projects of my own. I had been reading "Mathletics‚Äù by Wayne L. Winston, Scott Nestler, and Konstantinos Pelechrinis and found the material fascinating. I have always had passion for baseball and at this point believe that a position as a data analyst in a team's front office would be an amazing fit for me. Mathletic's in-depth explanations of complex sabermetric topics really helped my ability to grasp the difficult topics and their calculations use readily available data on the internet. The idea of following along with them throughout the book to build my understanding of the topics I was reading by recreating their calculations with up to date data was the origin of this project.

## Structure
The structure of the repository is simple. Each chapter folder contains a jupyter notebook that follows the calculations that the Mathletics authors discussed. I will not be explaining how or why they chose the statistics for two reasons:
1. I believe that this would be considered piracy. Since, this would in essence be taking their work and branding it as my own for any to consume without paying the authors anything.
2. I can only explain the topics discussed in the book worse than the authors. These are some of the best authors I have ever read and explain complex mathematical topics with admirable ease. To truly understand the material I am recreating, you must purchase and read the book for yourself.

However, following along like a robot recreating only and exactly what the authors have is boring and does little for me other than testing my knowledge of the syntax. I want this project to help me generate and explore new ideas that the authors either haven't thought about or cut from the final product. Any ideas that I have which deviate from the book I will thoroughly document with markdown cells in the chapter's notebooks

## Credits
Obviously, without the publication of Mathletics I would not have had this idea for a project. So I would like to thank all of the authors for their incredible and fascinating work.
I would also like to thank Sean Lahman for the data that he provided. He operates a database that anyone can access free of charge with millions of data points to use. While others \*cough* Baseball Reference \*cough* charge money for access to data that should be free. For that I am eternally grateful. The link to the dataset is below:
